<p>It's predecesor <a href="https://yesthisislouis.com/plot" style="color: #00aa11; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none;">🌳🌳 plot 🌳🌳</a>, had the same idea with a less sophisticated implementation. Crayon <strike>is not as charming</strike> will eventually be as charming as plot, and it is slightly better built, and easier to extend</p>
<p>Crayon is also a way to help me (Louis) understand developing tools from scratch</p>
<p>This is 🆚1️⃣, further developments before 🆚2️⃣ will include mobile functionality 📳</p>
