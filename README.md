🖍  
Crayon Emoji is a tool designed to make visual compositions using emojis, and to export those compositions as text that can be pasted into any text input or text editor.   
🖍🖍  
It is a 2 dimensional grid based system, where each character occupies one cell of a grid, and the input can be entered and selected along both the X and Y axis.   
🖍🖍🖍  
It is made in a way that can be extended in time.  

# Colophon
Crayon Emoji 🖍 is made by [Louis](http://yesthisislouis.com)  

It's based on an original tool I made called [Plot](http://yesthisislouis.com/plot)  

It's inspired by (very loosely) by using Orca and reading its source code  

I acknowledge the Wurundjeri Woi-Wurrung People as the Traditional Owners of the land upon which this work was made. Sovereignty has never been ceded.
