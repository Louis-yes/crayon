            <p>It's predecesor <a href="https://yesthisislouis.com/plot" style="color: #00aa11; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none;">🌳🌳 plot 🌳🌳</a>, had the same idea but was <strike>less complicated</strike> <strike>less confusing</strike> <strike>cuter</strike> less mobile friendly, and slightly less sophisticated. Crayon <strike>is not as charming</strike> will eventually be as charming as plot, and it is slightly better built, and easier to extend.</p>
            <p>Crayon is also a way to help me (Louis) understand developing tools from scratch</p>
            <p>This is v2.</p>
            <p>v3 will:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Run smoother</li>
                <li>Have some ui refinements</li>
                <li>Do plugins???</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Before v3 arrives you can expect to see a tutorial somewhere, and a gallery page</p>
